# Hi there!

My name is Bryan and I'm the author of this blog. I made this blog to help me present my ideas and projects more easily, and document my journey learning new technologies. I hope it can also be a resource to new developers or students trying to become involved in the world of tech.

## Background

I've been programming with C++ since 2016 and have been using computers since I was a child playing games on Windows 3.1 and exploring it's menus and features. I studied Software Engineering at SJSU and developed websites, web apps, and video games. My love for video games and technology has kept me intrigued and eager to learn about new developments in all fields of technology.

## Current Goal

My current goal is to break into the field of IT and cybersecurity. I'm still inexperienced working directly in IT but I have a lot of adjacent knowledge and skills to assist me. I am eager and hungry to learn as much as I can.

### Hobbies

When I'm not learning or working, I enjoy playing video games, such as League of Legends or Path of Exile. Video games are a big passion for me, even though I don't have as much time to enjoy it. I also make to develop my own video game, I have big ideas that I'm paring down into something I can realistically complete.

Movies have also been a big part of my life. When I wasn't on the computer, I was watching movies as a child. I would memorize movies line for line. Movies inspire me to this day to create video games and find new experiences in life.

Going to the gym and lifting weights is a new passion of mine. When I was younger, I had no interest in the discomfort from destroying my muscles and feeling sore after; now, it's an experience that has become a habit in my life that pushes me better myself physically.

I just started doing bonsai as well. I got a green thumb from my grandmother and have always been intrigued by the beauty of bonsai. I'm growing bonsai from seeds, but now that my seeds have sprouted, I can already tell that I'm going to want to get more varieties of bonsai trees to grow.
